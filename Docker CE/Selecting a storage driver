How to tell your distribution docker adaptor is:
    [user@khsoliman1 ~]$ docker info | grep Storage
WARNING: devicemapper: usage of loopback devices is strongly discouraged for production use.
         Use `--storage-opt dm.thinpooldev` to specify a custom block storage device.
Storage Driver: devicemapper

As root go to /etc/docker
vim daemon.json and add the following lines:

{
        "storage-driver":"devicemapper"
}

restart docker, if you have images on the system before this change you will have to export them and then reimport them:
    systemctl restart docker
